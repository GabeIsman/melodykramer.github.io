## The Backstory

Last August, I gave a speech about expanding the defintion of membership in public media.

>What does it mean to be a member of a public radio station in the United States? What could it mean? How could expanding the definition of membership instill a sense of ownership and identity among listeners, allowing them to feel more connected and invested in public media's content, work and mission?

I am spending the next eight weeks embedded at Harvard University on a Visiting Nieman Fellowship examining those questions. By the end, I hope to develop....something. I'm not sure what that something is yet. 

## Why not?

I'm a little scared of this fellowship. It gives me eight weeks of time, and to tell you the truth, I'm not sure of the best way to spend this time. What would have the most impact? What, if anything, should I build? How should I measure what works and what doesn't work? How can Harvard or people who work at Harvard help? I don't know yet.

I have eight weeks. That's a lot of time but also not a lot of time. I don't want to overpromise and underdeliver. I don't know what I don't know.  

## That's where you come in.

I'd like to treat this fellowship as a series of four two-week-sprints where we think about membership and community together. I see myself serving the role of facilitator or project manager. 

In each sprint, I will publish some background reading and some goals and my thoughts on a plan for achieving those goals, and then ask for your feedback to refine the sprint. Over the course of the two weeks, maybe I'll talk to people you recommend, examine or build tools, look at case studies, do research, do user testing, design something, or write something that we can look at together. Every morning, I'll update you - and we can shift goals accordingly.

At the end of every two week period, I will summarize and publish everything we learn during the sprint, and where that may lead us for the next sprint. I suspect what we learn will be applicable to more than just public media.

## I need a little more background where you're going with this, Mel.

Understandable. Let me explain why I'm doing this.
