We've tackled [push notifications before](http://melodykramer.github.io/what-does-a-better-push-notification-feel-like/), but we haven't talked about voice. Every push notification sounds like a headline. What if:

* You could sign up for push notifications from a particular editor? Or a friend? Or in a particular voice?
* You could opt to receive 10 delightful pushes over the course of a month, the way people opt in to wine-of-the-month clubs? We won't send more than 10 pushes to you in a month, and they will all make you smile (or learn something...or feel like part of a larger cohort...)
* You could respond to a push and know it went directly to an editor?

We have only tapped the surface of a push. You might say to yourself, "But I have turned off all pushes." Find a 14-year-old. Ask that 14-year-old if he/she minds pushes. The answer is likely different than your own.

Pushing and pulling,
Mel
