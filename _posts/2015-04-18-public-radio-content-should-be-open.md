1. In this essay, I explain why I believe public media stations and entities should make their software open source and some of their content available under a Creative Commons license. This essay will be broken into three sections: first, explaining what public media's mission is, and the background and inspiration for this thought exercise; second, explaining why creating open source products and creative commons content are part of the key to fulfilling public media's mission, and third, how creating in the open strengthens public media as a type of media in the United States.

## Background and Inspiration

2. From [NPR's original mission statement](http://current.org/2012/05/national-public-radio-purposes/): "The total service should be trustworthy, enhance intellectual development, expand knowledge, deepen aural esthetic enjoyment, increase the pleasure of living in a pluralistic society and result in a *service to listeners* which makes them more responsive, informed human beings and intelligent responsible citizens of their communities and the world....National Public Radio *will not regard its audience as a "market" or in terms of its disposable income, but as curious, complex individuals who are looking for some understanding, meaning and joy in the human experience.*"

3. From [a 2012 speech](http://current.org/2012/06/14260/) by Jay Allison: "For many of us, for some important core of us, public radio is a calling. *We believe in a civic responsibility and in civil behavior.* That’s a precious combination, because it’s increasingly rare. Our listeners know this about us. It’s why they trust us. And it’s why people want to join our cause — as supporters and participants...We should seek out our likely collaborators. Build partnerships with other groups who have kinship with us: arts groups, civic organizations, schools, museums, social services, all the nonprofits involved in making our places better. *We can act as a key connector in community*."

4. From [a 2005 Ford Foundation report prepared by the Public Media ThinkTank at American University](http://current.org/2005/09/what-makes-public-broadcasting-public-is-engagement/): 

> Public engagement is the heart of public broadcasting — and the best argument why taxpayers as well as donors and foundations need to support their public media.

> Public media are media whose mission is to serve, build and nurture an informed, engaged public. They include pubcasting stations, cable-access centers, DBS set-aside channels, low-power stations and even media arts organizations and museums.

> Even commercial media — such as judicious journalism or commercial cable’s prestige projects — sometimes fulfill public missions.

> Some public media are big institutions; some are so informal that they come out of people’s living rooms. *What they have in common is that they serve and need the public.* That makes them different from other media, which serve and need customers.

5. Also from the [2005 Ford Foundation report](http://current.org/2005/09/what-makes-public-broadcasting-public-is-engagement/): 

> "*Putting the project of public engagement at the center of public media addresses several nagging problems for broadcasters.* It shows why public broadcasters are different from other media that may be noncommercial but not necessarily public — for instance media produced by religious groups or nonprofits. It also shows the difference between having lots of information (which generates media smog) and having information that matters.

>Putting the public in the center also demonstrates how public broadcasting is a nonpartisan and unapologetically vigorous advocate of public life. It’s the exit from the squirrel-cage discussion of fairness and balance. As members of the public, we need to know more about the underlying problems of our society and government."

6. From an [FCC report on non-profit media](http://transition.fcc.gov/osp/inc-report/INoC-31-Nonprofit-Media.pdf): 

>If a tech fund systematically unleashes open source software applications and the technology needed to operate them, and grants money for code, coders and computers to news organizations across the country, *it could spread public media innovation faster into new groups and deeper into existing ones, and create nothing less than a news renaissance in America.*

>“Everyone can win here. *A local newspaper, a commercial or public broadcaster, ethnic and alternative media, citizen media, new web-based startups, all of them can use open source news technology. The technology does not care whether they are liberal or conservative, old or young, city dwellers or rural Americans, black or white or any color of the rainbow.* People will still be free to choose what news they would like to consume; they will, in fact, have greater choice in a media ecosystem richer in local media.

And:

> Stations are free to collaborate, but neither CPB funding criteria, FCC licensing criteria, nor other national institutional strictures have incentivized them to do so. Indeed, some station managers seem to believe that collaboration will
hurt their ability to distinguish themselves in the community and attract funding. 

> What will “infrastructure” mean in the future? Basic infrastructure will no longer be limited to radio towers and satellite dishes, but will involve software, digital platforms, digital delivery systems, and applications. 


### Thoughts






*Why creating open source products and creative commons content are part of the key to fulfilling this mission*

2. Open source software is software that does not charge users a purchase or licensing fee for modifying or redistributing the source code, in our projects and contribute back to the open source community.

3. Creating free or open source software is particularly suitable for rapid prototyping and experimentation. The testing process generates minimal costs, and the process encourages the identification and elimination of defects not recognized by the original development team.

Free or open source software also Community involvement. Publicly available source code enables continuous and broad peer review. Whether simply publishing the completed code or opening the development process, the practice of expanding the review and testing process to a wider audience—beyond the development team—ensures increased software reliability and security. Developing in the open also allows for other opinions to help adjust the direction of a product to maximize its usefulness to the community it serves.

Cost-savings. The ability to modify FOSS enables 18F to respond rapidly to changing missions and markets. Support and maintenance of open source code—as opposed to more burdensome usages of proprietary software—provides a real cost advantage where multiple copies of software are required, or when the user base grows. The total cost of ownership is shared with a community, rather than solely 18F.

Reusability. The code we create belongs to the American people as a part of the public domain. The code we work on was paid for by the American people, but the end-product is not the only way they should be able to interact with their government. By coding in FOSS, we help populate a larger commons that cities, states, businesses, and citizens can participate in. This creates real economic value by lowering the burden of replicating similar work or by allowing the private sector to build off of and create new businesses around code developed at 18F.





3. Some public radio stations make [some of their software open source](https://github.com/melodykramer/PublicMedia#repos). This is done on an ad-hoc basis.
