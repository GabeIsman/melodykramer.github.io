1. In this essay, I am going to write why I believe public media stations and entities should make their software open source and some of their content available under a Creative Commons license. This essay will be broken into three sections: first, explaining what public media's mission is, second, explaining why creating open source products and creative commons content are part of the key to fulfilling this mission, and third, how this strengthens us as a network and as a type of media.

*Background and Inspiration*

2. From [NPR's original mission statement](http://current.org/2012/05/national-public-radio-purposes/): "The total service should be trustworthy, enhance intellectual development, expand knowledge, deepen aural esthetic enjoyment, increase the pleasure of living in a pluralistic society and result in a service to listeners which makes them more responsive, informed human beings and intelligent responsible citizens of their communities and the world....National Public Radio *will not regard its audience as a "market" or in terms of its disposable income, but as curious, complex individuals who are looking for some understanding, meaning and joy in the human experience.*"

3. From [a 2012 speech](http://current.org/2012/06/14260/) by Jay Allison: "For many of us, for some important core of us, public radio is a calling. *We believe in a civic responsibility and in civil behavior.* That’s a precious combination, because it’s increasingly rare. Our listeners know this about us. It’s why they trust us. And it’s why people want to join our cause — as supporters and participants...We should seek out our likely collaborators. Build partnerships with other groups who have kinship with us: arts groups, civic organizations, schools, museums, social services, all the nonprofits involved in making our places better. *We can act as a key connector in community*."



*Why creating open source products and creative commons content are part of the key to fulfilling this mission*

2. Open source software is software that does not charge users a purchase or licensing fee for modifying or redistributing the source code, in our projects and contribute back to the open source community.

3. Creating free or open source software is particularly suitable for rapid prototyping and experimentation. The testing process generates minimal costs, and the process encourages the identification and elimination of defects not recognized by the original development team.

Free or open source software also Community involvement. Publicly available source code enables continuous and broad peer review. Whether simply publishing the completed code or opening the development process, the practice of expanding the review and testing process to a wider audience—beyond the development team—ensures increased software reliability and security. Developing in the open also allows for other opinions to help adjust the direction of a product to maximize its usefulness to the community it serves.

Cost-savings. The ability to modify FOSS enables 18F to respond rapidly to changing missions and markets. Support and maintenance of open source code—as opposed to more burdensome usages of proprietary software—provides a real cost advantage where multiple copies of software are required, or when the user base grows. The total cost of ownership is shared with a community, rather than solely 18F.

Reusability. The code we create belongs to the American people as a part of the public domain. The code we work on was paid for by the American people, but the end-product is not the only way they should be able to interact with their government. By coding in FOSS, we help populate a larger commons that cities, states, businesses, and citizens can participate in. This creates real economic value by lowering the burden of replicating similar work or by allowing the private sector to build off of and create new businesses around code developed at 18F.





3. Some public radio stations make [some of their software open source](https://github.com/melodykramer/PublicMedia#repos). This is done on an ad-hoc basis.
